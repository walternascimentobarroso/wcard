Ensure consistent organization of TypeScript interfaces and types across the project, keeping components clean and maintaining a scalable architecture.

## Required Rules

1. **All interfaces and types (`interface`, `type`, `enum`) must be stored in:**

```
types/
```

or in domain-based subfolders:

```
types/<domain>/
````

2. **Defining interfaces inside React component files is strictly forbidden.**  
Invalid example:
```ts
// ❌ Not allowed
interface Props { ... }
export default function Button() { ... }
````

3. **All interfaces and types must be exported:**

   ```ts
   export interface User { ... }
   ```

4. **Global declarations must only be placed in:**

   ```
   @types/
   ```

   and should be limited to:

   * `.d.ts` files
   * global object extensions (e.g., `Window`, `NodeJS.Process`)

5. **All files must import types from `types` using absolute imports:**

   ```ts
   import { User } from "@/types/user";
   ```

6. **Type duplication is not allowed.**
   Shared or cross-domain types must be placed in:

   ```
   types/common/
   ```

## 📁 Recommended Structure

```

  types/
    user/
      user.ts
      user-profile.ts
    product/
      product.ts
    common/
      pagination.ts
  @types/
    global.d.ts
```

## 🎯 Rationale

* Promotes clean and maintainable components
* Centralizes all type definitions
* Avoids redundancy and naming conflicts
* Encourages scalable and predictable architecture
* Aligns with modern frontend engineering best practices

```
