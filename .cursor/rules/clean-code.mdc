## Clean Code Principles

* Follow the **DRY** principle by centralizing repeated logic and avoiding duplication
* Maintain the **KISS** principle by keeping implementations simple and avoiding unnecessary complexity
* Apply the **YAGNI** principle: implement features only when they are truly needed
* Use **early return** to reduce nesting and improve readability
* Do **not** use `else`; prefer guard clauses and flat code structures
* Follow **SOLID** principles whenever possible to keep the system maintainable and extensible
* Keep code minimal, splitting logic into smaller files/modules when appropriate
* Always write comments in English, whenever comments are necessary
