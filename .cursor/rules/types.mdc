All TypeScript interfaces, types, and enums must be stored inside the `types/` directory or in domain-specific subfolders such as `types/<domain>/`. Defining interfaces or types inside React component files is not allowed.

All type definitions must be exported and imported using absolute paths (e.g., `@/types/user/user`). Relative imports are not permitted.

Global declarations are only allowed inside the `@types/` directory, limited to `.d.ts` files or global object extensions.

Duplicated types are not allowed. Shared or cross-domain definitions must be placed inside `types/common/`.

Recommended structure:


```
  types/
    user/
      user.ts
      user-profile.ts
    product/
      product.ts
    common/
      pagination.ts
  @types/
    global.d.ts
```
